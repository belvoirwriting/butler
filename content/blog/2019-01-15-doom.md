We have a picture as a writing prompt for our next meeting. You can use it to kick off your next idea and bring a short story, poem, article, chapter, memoir or whatever you’d like to write. Perhaps think about some of these questions: What’s happening? Who are these people? How do they feel? What do they want and what’s stopping them? Where have they been and where are they going?

The suggested writing theme is entirely optional. Bring along whatever you’re working on or just join in to hear what others have written.

We’ll meet at 8pm on Tuesday 8 September 2020 via Google Meet.
